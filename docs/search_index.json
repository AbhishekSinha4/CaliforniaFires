According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the state agency that oversees climate change programs and pollution control efforts, “climate change, primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels, is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires not only in California but also all over the world. Since 1950, the area burned by California wildfires each year has been increasing, as spring and summer temperatures have warmed and spring snowmelt has occurred earlier.” In this project, our goal is to investigate the magnitude of changes in frequency and size of wildfires in California and the impacts in recent years that the wildfires have had on the economy, businesses, and people in the State of California. Our analysis focuses initially on identifying trends in wildfires in the last 35 years and then we proceed to look at their economic and human impact across the state and different regions in the period from 2015-2019. As some of the largest wildfires in California in recent years have been caused by electrical infrastructure (typically sparks from distribution and transmission lines), in the last part of our analysis we investigate the impact of wildfires on the wildfire prevention activities of the electric utility companies in California and costs associated with those activities. We specifically look at the level of capital and O&amp;M spending for the fire prevention activities of the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company, the power utility responsible for many large wildfires in northern California in the past 5 years, which had to make large financial settlement payouts to the fire victims and make significant investment in equipment and activities aimed at reducing the risk of future fires from utility equipment. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources In this project, we utilize the following data sources: Monitoring Trends in Burn “Severity (MTBS) https://www.mtbs.gov/index.php/direct-download As described on the MTBS’s website - “MTBS is an interagency program whose goal is to consistently map the burn severity and extent of large fires across all lands of the United States from 1984 to present. This includes all fires 1000 acres or greater in the western United States and 500 acres or greater in the eastern United States. The extent of coverage includes the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.” The dataset downloaded from this website contains historical records of fires (1000 acres or greater) in the State of California from 1984 to 2018. The variables included in the dataset are: Fire Name, Acres, Ignition Date, Fire Type, and Fire ID, and there are 1,810 total observations in the dataset. We utilize this data to investigate the trends in wildfire frequency and size over the the 35 year period covered by the dataset. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) https://www.fire.ca.gov/stats-events/ As stated on the website, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) is responsible for “the fire protection and stewardship of over 31 million acres of California’s privately-owned wildlands. In addition, the Department provides varied emergency services in 36 of the State’s 58 counties via contracts with local governments.” CAL FIRE is responsible for both fire prevention and fire suppression activities. Two key data sources (both in the PDF format) from the CAL FIRE website are used in this project: a) Annual “Wildfire Activity Statistics” (so-called “Redbooks”) for 2015-2019 (i) Table 5. Large Fires 300 Acres and Greater — Protection Area (ii) Table 6. Large Fires 300 Acres and Greater — Number of Fires and Acres Burned by State and Contract Counties Direct (iii) Table 18. Dollar Damage by Cause, by County The variables included in Tables 5 and 6 are: Incident Number, County, Fire Name, Date Start, Date Contained, Origin DPA, DPA Type, Acres Burned, Vegetation Type, Cause, Structures Destroyed, Structures Damaged, Fatalities Fire, Fatalities Civil. There are 388 total observations for each variable in these tables. The variables included in Table 18 are: Year, County, Total Cost, Arson, Campfire, Debris Burning, Electrical Power, Equipment Use, Lightning, Miscellaneous, Playing With Fire, Railroad, Smoking, Undetermined, and Vehicle. There are 252 total observations for each variable in these tables. Data in Tables 5 and 6 are used to investigate the wildfire sizes (acres burned) and their impact on property (structures destroyed and damaged) and human life (fire and civilian fatalities) by county, year, and cause, as well as the association between wildfire sizes and their impact on property and human life Data in Table 18 are used to determine association between monetary costs of wildfires and their underlying causes and are also tied to the data in Tables 5 and 6 by our examination of the relationships between the levels of fire size and property damage and total monetary cost. Suppression Costs This dataset is a table of recorded Emergency Fund Fire Suppression Expenditures incurred by CAL FIRE annually from 1979 to 2020 and is used in the analysis as a cost component in our estimation of the total monetary costs of wildfires in California. California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=6442461400 The CPUC is California’s chief regulatory body tasked with overseeing the utility companies in the state. As part of its effort to oversee the spending of power and gas utilities on safety-related activities, the CPUC has required the utilities to provide annual reports on spending for programs and activities whose goal is to mitigate risk of wildfires from utility infrastructure and equipment. Since Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) is the (electric) utility connected with many major wildfires in California in recent years, we utilize PG&amp;E’s “Risk Spending Accountability Reports” from 2015-2019 to investigate trends in the company’s spending on wildfire prevention activities as an indicator of additional costs that have been borne by the society (specifically utility ratepayers) as a result of the wildfires in recent years. The dataset specifically utilized in our analysis is a summary table provided by the Energy Division (a section of the CPUC) on the CPUC website that summarizes total PG&amp;E spending on wildfire prevention related “control” programs (by Maintenance Activity Type - MAT) from 2015 to 2019, augmented by the cost of an additional major “mitigation” program introduced in 2018. The variables include costs for individual “control” and “mitigation” wildfire risk-reduction programs (30 components) over the five-year period 2015-2019. While we did not encounter any major problems with the data, we had to be careful in relating the datasets collected from different sources to each other as some datasets contained summary information and not all summaries were done equally. For example, the CAL FIRE dataset on wildfire (individual) incidents in Tables 5 and 6 is limited to wildfires over 300 acres in size, whereas the dataset on Dollar Damage in Table 18 by county and cause includes all wildfires regardless of size. When contemplating the analysis of the relationship between the fire size and total costs we therefore had to investigate if the majority of the total cost is related to the incidents over 300 acres in size for which we had data or not. To accomplish that we utilized another table in the CAL FIRE dataset that breaks down total costs by wildfire size. As it turnss out, the wildfires over 300 acres account for almost all (97-98%) of the total cost. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation As our datasets mostly included PDF files, we primarily utilized Tabula software (https://tabula.technology) to get the data from the PDF files into CSV format. We next combined individual CSV files into a single CSV file for the entire period if applicable (e.g. for annual PDF report files) and then imported the all relevant CSV files into R for further analysis and visualization. The only exception to this process is the MTBS dataset on historical records of fires in the State of California from 1984 to 2018 which we were able to copy/paste from the website (by selecting all the cells in the table on the website) and into a CSV file directly. Finally, the CAL FIRE dataset in Table 6 (Dollar Damages) in year 2015 had finer granularity of cost breakdown the county level for some counties, so we aggregated those values to the county level. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values The only missing values we encountered in our datasets are in CAL FIRE Table 18 (Dollar Damage by Cause, by County). Specifically, those tables do not include damage costs for 6 (of 58) counties i.e. the so-called “Contract Counties” (Kern, Los Angeles, Marin, Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura). According to CAL FIRE, “The State contracts with six counties to provide protection of SRA within their boundaries.” While these counties apparently provided certain information on wildfire incidents (e.g. the data for the Contract Counties is provided in Tables 5 and 6), the damage costs (Table 18) were not provided for any of the years we examined in our analysis. We determined this information by visually comparing a list of California counties (available online) with the list of counties in the CAL FIRE dataset for Table 18. Some datasets like the Tables 5 and 6 from CAL FIRE did not contain values for all variables (e.g. Counties or Fatalities) and all incidents or years, however we could not conclude that they were missing because the observations were not recorded. For example, over the 5 year period not all counties had reported wildfire incidents with sizes over 300 acres during each year (typically 52-53 counties of 58 in total would have recorded information each year), nor all fire incidents would have recorded fatalities (most of them did not have any at all). In all of those cases it appeared that the information that was recorded was only for the events that occurred.

This is further emphasized by the rolling mean lines across 5 and 10 years which also show an upward trend. Next we explore the fire sizes. First we visualize a distribution of all fire incidents across 35 years. The graph between Count and Acres is incredibly right skewed which is expected as the number of fires with extremely large acre values reduces. The distribution is also very spread. To visualize this better hence, we take the log of the acre column as an axis instead. It is still clearly visible that the distribution of Acres Burned is incredibly right skewed. To explore this distribution further we explore the data by different fire types and visualize them as boxplots. It is clearly visible from the boxplot that wildfires contribute to the largest amount of Burned Acres but these are outliers mostly. The Median fire size for all types is relatively closer. To get a better picture of this general comparison, we remove outliers and replot the same visualization: This reaffirms that the medians are close to each other, however wildfires are also visibly more right skewed than the other types. “Out of Area Response” and “Complex” only have 1 row each and hence do not contribute much. We note from this analysis that wildfires seem to be the most prominent and head into the next part of our analysis to focus more on wildfire incidents over the last 5 years. 5.2 Analysis of wildfire incidents in California from 2015 to 2019 5.2.0.0.1 Annual data on Acres Burned, Property Destroyed or Damaged, and Human Fatalities We visualize the impact caused by fires over the past 5 years to get an understanding of the scale of damage caused over the years. 2018 seems to have been the most damaging in terms of lives lost and acres burned but 2017 seems to peak in terms of most structures destroyed and damaged. 5.2.0.0.2 Annual data by County (Acres Burned, Property Destroyed or Damaged, and Human Fatalities) We visualize the impact caused by fires to each county to get an understanding of which counties have been most impacted in terms of acres lost, structures damaged and lives lost. Butte County seems to have lost a lot of lives in 2018 and Napa consistently seems to be showing cause for concern. It can be noted here though that no county seems to have been consistently harmed every year, (rather large incidents are not that frequent it seems). 5.2.0.0.3 Causes of wildfires with the most impact on Acres Burned, Property Destroyed or Damaged, and Human Fatalities We visualize the impact caused by fires by cause to get an understanding of which causes require the most concern. Electric Power based incidents seem to have a significant human cost (lives lost and property damage) while most acres seemed to have been burned by undetermined sources (rural areas?). 5.2.0.0.4 Financial $ damages and their correlation with Acres Burned, Property Destroyed or Damaged, and Human Fatalities (by County) The most financial damage was caused by Electic Power, consistent with our previous impact analysis. Having seem the large impact caused by various fire causes over the years, we look at relationships that might exist there. 5.3 Correlation of the key wildfire impacts (Acres Burned, Property Destroyed or Damaged, and Human Fatalities) We plot scatter We plot a correlation matrix between the various impact columns as a heat map and everything demonstrates some amount of positive correlation. Importantly however, damaged properties seem to share a very high correlation with civilian deaths. For the other columns we look at scatterplots to understand them better. It is clear from the scatter plots that while they had a positive correlation value, the columns do not seem to have too strong of a relationship. The high positive value might be due to the presence of many low and zero values in the impact columns. “Structural damages” and “Acres” burned do seem to have some positive relationship but it is not too strong. 5.4 All financial costs taken together Finally we visualize all the Finances that go into these fire incidents and compare the amount of money spent yearly for fire prevention, the amount in terms of damages and the cost of suppressing the fire itself. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In this project we investigated trends in frequency and sizes of wildfires in California as well as their impact on the property and human life. The analysis of 35 years of fire data from 1984 to 2018 shows that the landmass (acres) burned by the wildfires has been steadily increasing over the years, with annual variation. When looking in more detail at the impacts of the wildfires in the 5 year period from 2105 to 2019, we notice that wildfires have caused a significant damage to property (in tens of billions of dollars) as well as to the human life (more than 150 lives lost). Our investigation of causes of wildfires that lead to major loss of property and life shows that the cause with the biggest impact has been electrical infrastructure and equipment. Though the electrical utilities like PG&amp;E have been increasing their investments in wildfire prevention activities and programs to monitor electrical infrastructure better over the past years (as shown by the Risk Spending Accountability Reports from the CPUC), it is clear that more needs to be done in the future. One possible extension of our analysis in the future is to investigate connection between the weather conditions (temperature, rainfall) and the wildfires in California. Due to the limited time we could devote to this project, we were unable to explore that direction at this time. "]]
